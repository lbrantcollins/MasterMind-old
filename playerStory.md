# MasterMind Player Story Board

(and brief notes on DOM manipulation)

#### 1. Player enters their name (and chooses difficulty level)

  * The name allows for a personalized welcome to the game

#### 2. Computer choose a code at random

  * Since colors can be re-used in the code, each of the four positions may be filled with any of the four colors at random
  * Obviously, the code is stored and not displayed to the user
    
#### 3. Player chooses colors and positions for their guess

  * The available colors will be displayed below the game board in a container div with event delegation for each color
  * The set of four blank pegs for the guess will also be a container div with event delegation for each peg location
  * the player clicks on any blank (or filled) peg to add/change a color for the peg
  * color is added to the selected peg by the player clicking on any of the colors displayed below the game board.
  * the player can change their mind by clicking the peg again 
    * this will blank out the peg and the player can choose a new color
  * to move on, the player clicks another peg in the guess area and adds color the same as for the first peg
  * Once the player is satisfied with their guess (a desired color placed into each of the 4 peg positions), they click a button to submit the guess
  
#### 4. The computer responds to the player  

  * See the brief description on the computer's response on the README file
  * Once the computer has determined the appropriate response
    * The black pegs (if any correct color and position guessed) are placed in the response area first, then the white pegs (if any correct color, but wrong position)
    * If the guess does not use any of the colors in the code, the response will be nothing (no black or white pegs)
  * The code may include more than one of any of the colors. That is, not every color is required to appear in the code.  
  * In the extreme, a code where every peg is the same color is allowed.
  * The set of 4 available colors is known by the player, but the player does **not** know the code generated by the computer.
  
#### 5. Player continues to the next row of pegs to make another guess

  * The current row of pegs will be highlighted

#### 6. Player continues with guesses until...

  * The game ends when either
    * **WIN:** the player guesses the correct code
    * **LOSE:** 8 incorrect guesses have been made
